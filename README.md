# SudokuSolverKeras

An attempt to teach python to solve sudoku puzzles without knowing the rules of sudoku

I'm using Tensorflow Keras to set up the neural network (testing with Sequential model)

The sudoku puzzles and solutions are downloaded from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku/data#

But can also be generated using the code from this website:
